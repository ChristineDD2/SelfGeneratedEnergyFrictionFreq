''' After simplified imports continue to create a class for a ApplicationEnergy. define a method after the class reconignition provide a
 structure of self generating energy theory in you first defined method! one example of defining self generated energy would be taking energy 
 and assigning it current energy level or wattage! proceeding with a genuine unique coding to define a procedure to multiply molecules and particles 
 to continuously generate self precision self replicated cells generating a level of energy where friction meets frequency and the energies frequency finds 
 friction creating a self rounding circular motion to repeating 1 from zero continously dropping 1 and replenishing zero with +1 particle of energizing 
 molecular frequencies and molecules'''


'''I will now define class and define method to create a foundation to alway be generating +1 particle from zero the set current energy level of someone close by the function when run without debugging'''
